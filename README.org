** TODO Make SwiftOrg compile

- SwiftOrg was written for Swift 3.
- Is it possible to mix various versions of Swift source? Is it what =// swift-tools-version:5.3= declaration is for? In that case I only need to change it to =3=. See [[https://medium.com/swiftify/swift-5-1-module-format-stability-best-time-migrate-objective-c-frameworks-a0434f5352a3]].
- Is it possible to mix various versions of Swift bytecode? Compile it with Swift 3 and include as a package? No idea whether this is a thing in Swift.
- If not, I should ask the [[https://github.com/madyankin][guy of the fork]] whether he managed to fix the code for Swift 5, as he's clearly using it.
- I should also ask the original author whether they plan to upgrade it. (Wait until here to have my research done.)
- If everything fails, I'm left with two options: either downgrade my Swift to the highest version it works well on OR fix it for Swift 5 myself.
